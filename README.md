# React-News_Web
A web application for news, whose frontend is implemented by using React and whose backend is developed in Express. The frontend can display news by news types, search for news by given keywords and also cache the favourite news into local storage. Besides, I utilized React-Bootstrap as well as media queries in SCSS to achieve responsive development and used page routing to implement the logic between each page. 

Regarding the backend, I used express to deliver different news and search results to different requests.
